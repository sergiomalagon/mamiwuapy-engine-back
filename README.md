# Smoll

Node library for server creation with routing. 

Don't bother sending PR's, I won't be reviewing them. I have this project public just to use the beneficts of public projects in GitHub. If you don't like something you can fork it.

If you find bugs please report them.

Be aware, the API could break at any update.
